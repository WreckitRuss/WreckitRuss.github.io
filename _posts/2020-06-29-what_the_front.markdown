I have never blogged before, so please bear with me. 

I have spent the last 15 years of my life chasing the dream of being a pro athlete...successfullyi may add. However, quarantine has showed me how essential I am, and I decided to do something about it. I began learning to code on my own using youtube and google videos and articles I found, but had hit a virtual wall. In my search for something better, I found career Karma and Flatiron. The challenges I face are no different than those I have encountered throughout the accumulated years of training my body and mind for physical contact. I enjoy conquering the labs, especially the difficult ones I find here on Learn. I feel that I am hitting my stride in this course, and that things are starting to make some sense to me. I compare this to learning a new language altogether, and that language is computer. 

Before I know it I'll be coding like the pros in no time.
