 As this will be my second time taking this course (I fully intend to pass this time), I thought I would talk about why I am taking trying to fing a life in coding at all. I have spent the last 15 years as a professional MMA fighter, I have fought in the biggest organizations in the world. A few years ago things started to spiral downhill for me and i just couldn't seem to find my footing. Fast forward to about 6 months ago when covid broke out and I not only had to stop working, I had to close down the gym I own that not only makes up a chunk of my income, but costs a lot to maintain. With all the stress i carried, I landed myself in the hospital, having a minor seizure while asleep. That was a wake up call for me that I not only had to stress less but that I wanted to find a way to make a living after fighting, one that didn't include me taking shots to the head daily. 
 
 With this I know that I can build the life I want outside of the fight world. One where I can still provide for my family, and keep my health. thanks for reading.
